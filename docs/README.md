# Tips to not get banned
?> Say it loud: **Don't be afraid to use it. If you are afraid of getting banned, don't use it.** <br>
DO IT ON YOUR OWN RISK. There are recommended values shared by other players in recommended values.
- Client-side cheats such as ESP, HideUI, FPS unlock is relatively safe.
- Do not generate unreasonable data(score and time) in abyss or event. Strongly recommend you to check other normal player's data.
- Teleports should have 30~60s delay. Complete domain >15s.
- Do not open too many chests and pickup too many items in short period of time. 
- Multiplayer is not recommended. Getting reported by other players has a high risk of getting banned.
